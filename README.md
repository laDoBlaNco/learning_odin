# learning_odin

My path learning the Odin programming language. This seems like it'll be my replacement
systems  language and will compliment my passion for Go.

## My Goals
My goals with this project is really just to learn Odin and see if I can start to use it
as my goto systems hacking language. I love Go and TinyGo, but there are specific diffs
that I appreciate in Odin. 

Though I'm just going through the demo and the examples, I'm also adding in my thoughts to
the already great comments which helps me reason and understand about the language semantics.
